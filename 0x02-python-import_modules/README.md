Python - import & modules
 ------------------
This Project is done during **Full Stack Software Engineering Study @ Alx_Africa/Holberton_School** it aims is to learn about:-
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to use the built-in function `dir()`
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

Technologies
 ------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- Interpreted/compiled using python3 `3.8.5`
- Tested on ubuntu `20.04 LTS`
- Files are written according to pycodestyle `2.10.0` standard

Files
 ---------------------------
The following files are scripts and programs written in Python| Filename | Description |
| --- | ---|
| `0-add.py` | A program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3` |

| `2-args.py` | A program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments. |
| `3-infinite_add.py` | A program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments |
| `4-hidden_discovery.py` | A program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc` |
| `5-variable_load.py` | A program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value. |
| `100-my_calculator.py` | A program that imports all functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations. |
| `101-easy_print.py` | A program that prints `#pythoniscool`, followed by a new line, in the standard output. |
