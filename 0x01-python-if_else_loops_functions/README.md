Python - if/else, loops, functions
 ---------------------
This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies @ alx africa. it aims was to learn about:-
- Why Python programming is awesome
- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the `while` and `for` loops
- How is Python’s `for` different from C‘s?
- How to use the `break` and `continues` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it.
- How to use `range`
- What is a function and how do you use functions
What does return a function that does not use any `return` statement
- Scope of variables
- What’s a traceback
-What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

Technologies
 --------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`                
- All Python files are intepreted using `Python3 (3.8.5)` 
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All codes tested with `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)` 
 
Files
 ----------------------
The following files are scripts and programs written in Python:-
| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`0-positive_or_negative.py` | Assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the [`source code`](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative. |
| `1-last_digit.py` | Will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the [`source code`](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`. |
| `3-print_alphabt.py` | Prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. |
| `4-print_hexa.py` | Prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal. |
