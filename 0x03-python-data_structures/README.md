Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
 ---------------------------
This Project is done during `Full Stack Software Engineering Study @ Alx_Africa/Holberton_School` it aims is to learn about:-
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the `del` statement and how to use it

Technologies
 ---------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)` 
- Interpreted/compiled using python3 `3.8.5` 
- Tested on ubuntu `20.04 LTS`
- Files are written according to pycodestyle `2.10.0` standard

Files
 -------------------------
The following files are scriptsand programs written in python3;

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0-print_list_integer.py` | A function that prints all integers of a list. |
| `1-element_at.py` | A function that retrieves an element from a list like in C. |
| `2-replace_in_list.py` | A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C). |
| `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py` | A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order. |
| `4-new_in_list.py` | A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C). |
| `5-no_c.py` | A function that removes all characters c and C from a string. |
| `6-print_matrix_integer.py` |A function that prints a matrix of integers. |
| `7-add_tuple.py` | A function that adds 2 tuples. |
| `8-multiple_returns.py` | A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character. |
| `9-max_integer.py` | A function that finds the biggest integer of a list. |
| `10-divisible_by_2.py` | A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list. |
| `11-delete_at.py` | A function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list. |
| `12-switch.py` | Complete the [`source code`](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x03.py/blob/master/12-switch_py) in order to switch value of `a` and `b` |
 | [`13-is_palindrome.c`] | **Technical interview preparation** Linked lists. |
